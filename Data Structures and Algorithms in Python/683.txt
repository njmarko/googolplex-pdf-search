           Algorithm ShortestPath(G, s):
                 Input: A weighted graph G with nonnegative edge weights, and a distinguished
                    vertex s of G.
                 Output: The length of a shortest path from s to v for each vertex v of G.
                  Initialize D[s] = 0 and D[v] = ∞ for each vertex v = s.
                  Let a priority queue Q contain all the vertices of G using the D labels as keys.
                  while Q is not empty do
                     {pull a new vertex u into the cloud}
                     u = value returned by Q.remove min()
                     for each vertex v adjacent to u such that v is in Q do
                        {perform the relaxation procedure on edge (u, v)}
                        if D[u] + w(u, v) < D[v] then
                             D[v] = D[u] + w(u, v)
                             Change to D[v] the key of vertex v in Q.
                  return the label D[v] of each vertex v

           Figure 14.15: An execution of Dijkstra’s algorithm on a weighted graph. The start
           vertex is BWI. A box next to each vertex v stores the label D[v]. The edges of
           the shortest-path tree are drawn as thick arrows, and for each vertex u outside the
           “cloud” we show the current best edge for pulling in u with a thick line. (Continues
