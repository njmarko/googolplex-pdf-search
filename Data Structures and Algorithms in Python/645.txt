    Figure 14.3: Examples of reachability in a directed graph: (a) a directed path from
    BOS to LAX is highlighted; (b) a directed cycle (ORD, MIA, DFW, LAX, ORD) is
    highlighted; its vertices induce a strongly connected subgraph; (c) the subgraph of
    the vertices and edges reachable from ORD is highlighted; (d) the removal of the
    dashed edges results in an acyclic directed graph.
    Example 14.7: Perhaps the most talked about graph today is the Internet, which
    can be viewed as a graph whose vertices are computers and whose (undirected)
    edges are communication connections between pairs of computers on the Inter-
    net. The computers and the connections between them in a single domain, like
    wiley.com, form a subgraph of the Internet. If this subgraph is connected, then two
    users on computers in this domain can send email to one another without having
    their information packets ever leave their domain. Suppose the edges of this sub-
    graph form a spanning tree. This implies that, if even a single connection goes
    down (for example, because someone pulls a communication cable out of the back
    of a computer in this domain), then this subgraph will no longer be connected.
