       Separate Chaining
       Code Fragment 10.5 provides a concrete implementation of a hash table with sepa-
       rate chaining, in the form of the ChainHashMap class. To represent a single bucket,
       it relies on an instance of the UnsortedTableMap class from Code Fragment 10.3.
            The ﬁrst three methods in the class use index j to access the potential bucket in
       the bucket array, and a check for the special case in which that table entry is None.
       The only time we need a new bucket structure is when bucket setitem is called on
       an otherwise empty slot. The remaining functionality relies on map behaviors that
       are already supported by the individual UnsortedTableMap instances. We need a
       bit of forethought to determine whether the application of setitem on the chain
       causes a net increase in the size of the map (that is, whether the given key is new).
