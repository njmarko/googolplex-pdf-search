11.6. Red-Black Trees                                                                      515
           Case 1: The Sibling s of y Is Black (or None). (See Figure 11.33.) In this case,
                 the double red denotes the fact that we have added the new node to a cor-
                 responding 3-node of the (2, 4) tree T  , effectively creating a malformed
                 4-node. This formation has one red node (y) that is the parent of another
                 red node (x), while we want it to have the two red nodes as siblings instead.
                 To ﬁx this problem, we perform a trinode restructuring of T . The trinode
                 restructuring is done by the operation restructure(x), which consists of the
                 following steps (see again Figure 11.33; this operation is also discussed in
                 Section 11.2):
                    • Take node x, its parent y, and grandparent z, and temporarily relabel
                       them as a, b, and c, in left-to-right order, so that a, b, and c will be
                       visited in this order by an inorder tree traversal.
                    • Replace the grandparent z with the node labeled b, and make nodes a
                       and c the children of b, keeping inorder relationships unchanged.
                 After performing the restructure(x) operation, we color b black and we color
                 a and c red. Thus, the restructuring eliminates the double-red problem. No-
                 tice that the portion of any path through the restructured part of the tree is
                 incident to exactly one black node, both before and after the trinode restruc-
                 turing. Therefore, the black depth of the tree is unaffected.
