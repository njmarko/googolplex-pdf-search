    R-14.21 Compute a topological ordering for the directed graph drawn with solid
            edges in Figure 14.3d.
    R-14.22 Bob loves foreign languages and wants to plan his course schedule for the
            following years. He is interested in the following nine language courses:
            LA15, LA16, LA22, LA31, LA32, LA126, LA127, LA141, and LA169.
            The course prerequisites are:
                • LA15: (none)
                • LA16: LA15
                • LA22: (none)
                • LA31: LA15
                • LA32: LA16, LA31
                • LA126: LA22, LA32
                • LA127: LA16
                • LA141: LA22, LA16
                • LA169: LA32
            In what order can Bob take these courses, respecting the prerequisites?
    R-14.23 Draw a simple, connected, weighted graph with 8 vertices and 16 edges,
            each with unique edge weights. Identify one vertex as a “start” vertex and
            illustrate a running of Dijkstra’s algorithm on this graph.
    R-14.24 Show how to modify the pseudo-code for Dijkstra’s algorithm for the case
            when the graph is directed and we want to compute shortest directed paths
            from the source vertex to all the other vertices.
    R-14.25 Draw a simple, connected, undirected, weighted graph with 8 vertices and
            16 edges, each with unique edge weights. Illustrate the execution of the
            Prim-Jarnı́k algorithm for computing the minimum spanning tree of this
            graph.
    R-14.26 Repeat the previous problem for Kruskal’s algorithm.
    R-14.27 There are eight small islands in a lake, and the state wants to build seven
            bridges to connect them so that each island can be reached from any other
            one via one or more bridges. The cost of constructing a bridge is propor-
            tional to its length. The distances between pairs of islands are given in the
            following table.
