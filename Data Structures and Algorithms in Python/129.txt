 Chapter Notes
     For a broad overview of developments in computer science and engineering, we refer the
     reader to The Computer Science and Engineering Handbook [96]. For more information
     about the Therac-25 incident, please see the paper by Leveson and Turner [69].
          The reader interested in studying object-oriented programming further, is referred to
     the books by Booch [17], Budd [20], and Liskov and Guttag [71]. Liskov and Guttag
     also provide a nice discussion of abstract data types, as does the survey paper by Cardelli
     and Wegner [23] and the book chapter by Demurjian [33] in the The Computer Science
     and Engineering Handbook [96]. Design patterns are described in the book by Gamma et
     al. [41].
          Books with speciÔ¨Åc focus on object-oriented programming in Python include those
     by Goldwasser and Letscher [43] at the introductory level, and by Phillips [83] at a more
     advanced level,
