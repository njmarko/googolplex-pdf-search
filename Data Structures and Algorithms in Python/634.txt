           R-13.1 List the preﬁxes of the string P ="aaabbaaa" that are also sufﬁxes of P.
           R-13.2 What is the longest (proper) preﬁx of the string "cgtacgttcgtacg" that
                    is also a sufﬁx of this string?
           R-13.3 Draw a ﬁgure illustrating the comparisons done by brute-force pattern
                    matching for the text "aaabaadaabaaa" and pattern "aabaaa".
           R-13.4 Repeat the previous problem for the Boyer-Moore algorithm, not counting
                    the comparisons made to compute the last(c) function.
           R-13.5 Repeat Exercise R-13.3 for the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, not count-
                    ing the comparisons made to compute the failure function.
           R-13.6 Compute a map representing the last function used in the Boyer-Moore
                    pattern-matching algorithm for characters in the pattern string:
                               "the quick brown fox jumped over a lazy cat".
           R-13.7 Compute a table representing the Knuth-Morris-Pratt failure function for
                    the pattern string "cgtacgttcgtac".
           R-13.8 What is the best way to multiply a chain of matrices with dimensions that
                    are 10 × 5, 5 × 2, 2 × 20, 20 × 12, 12 × 4, and 4 × 60? Show your work.
           R-13.9 In Figure 13.8, we illustrate that GTTTAA is a longest common subse-
                    quence for the given strings X and Y . However, that answer is not unique.
                    Give another common subsequence of X and Y having length six.
          R-13.10 Show the longest common subsequence array L for the two strings:
                                              X    = "skullandbones"
                                              Y    = "lullabybabies"
                    What is a longest common subsequence between these strings?
          R-13.11 Draw the frequency array and Huffman tree for the following string:
                               "dogs do not spot hot pots or cats".
          R-13.12 Draw a standard trie for the following set of strings:
                      { abab, baba, ccccc, bbaaaa, caa, bbaacc, cbcc, cbca }.
          R-13.13 Draw a compressed trie for the strings given in the previous problem.
          R-13.14 Draw the compact representation of the sufﬁx trie for the string:
                               "minimize minime".
