            Figure 2.8: Conceptual view of three namespaces: (a) the class namespace for
            CreditCard; (b) the class namespace for PredatoryCreditCard; (c) the instance
            namespace for a PredatoryCreditCard object.
            How Entries Are Established in a Namespace
            It is important to understand why a member such as balance resides in a credit
            card’s instance namespace, while a member such as make payment resides in the
            class namespace. The balance is established within the init method when a
            new credit card instance is constructed. The original assignment uses the syntax,
            self. balance = 0, where self is an identiﬁer for the newly constructed instance.
            The use of self as a qualiﬁer for self. balance in such an assignment causes the
             balance identiﬁer to be added directly to the instance namespace.
                 When inheritance is used, there is still a single instance namespace per object.
            For example, when an instance of the PredatoryCreditCard class is constructed,
            the apr attribute as well as attributes such as balance and limit all reside in that
            instance’s namespace, because all are assigned using a qualiﬁed syntax, such as
            self. apr.
                 A class namespace includes all declarations that are made directly within the
            body of the class deﬁnition. For example, our CreditCard class deﬁnition included
            the following structure:
                  class CreditCard:
                    def make payment(self, amount):
                       ...
            Because the make payment function is declared within the scope of the CreditCard
            class, that function becomes associated with the name make payment within the
            CreditCard class namespace. Although member functions are the most typical
            types of entries that are declared in a class namespace, we next discuss how other
            types of data values, or even other classes can be declared within a class namespace.
