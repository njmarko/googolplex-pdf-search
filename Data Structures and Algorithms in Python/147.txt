         Thus, the highest-degree term in a polynomial is the term that determines the
    asymptotic growth rate of that polynomial. We consider some additional properties
    of the big-Oh notation in the exercises. Let us consider some further examples here,
    focusing on combinations of the seven fundamental functions used in algorithm
    design. We rely on the mathematical fact that logn ≤ n for n ≥ 1.
    Example 3.10: 5n2 + 3n log n + 2n + 5 is O(n2 ).
    Justiﬁcation: 5n2 + 3n log n+ 2n+ 5 ≤ (5+ 3+ 2+ 5)n2 = cn2 , for c = 15, when
    n ≥ n0 = 1.
    Example 3.11: 20n3 + 10n log n + 5 is O(n3 ).
    Justiﬁcation:       20n3 + 10n log n + 5 ≤ 35n3 , for n ≥ 1.
    Example 3.12: 3 log n + 2 is O(log n).
    Justiﬁcation: 3 log n + 2 ≤ 5 log n, for n ≥ 2. Note that log n is zero for n = 1.
    That is why we use n ≥ n0 = 2 in this case.
    Example 3.13: 2n+2 is O(2n ).
    Justiﬁcation:       2n+2 = 2n · 22 = 4 · 2n ; hence, we can take c = 4 and n0 = 1 in this
    case.
    Example 3.14: 2n + 100 log n is O(n).
    Justiﬁcation:       2n + 100 log n ≤ 102n, for n ≥ n0 = 1; hence, we can take c = 102
    in this case.
    Characterizing Functions in Simplest Terms
    In general, we should use the big-Oh notation to characterize a function as closely
    as possible. While it is true that the function f (n) = 4n3 + 3n2 is O(n5 ) or even
    O(n4 ), it is more accurate to say that f (n) is O(n3 ). Consider, by way of analogy,
    a scenario where a hungry traveler driving along a long country road happens upon
    a local farmer walking home from a market. If the traveler asks the farmer how
    much longer he must drive before he can ﬁnd some food, it may be truthful for the
    farmer to say, “certainly no longer than 12 hours,” but it is much more accurate
    (and helpful) for him to say, “you can ﬁnd a market just a few minutes drive up this
    road.” Thus, even with the big-Oh notation, we should strive as much as possible
    to tell the whole truth.
         It is also considered poor taste to include constant factors and lower-order terms
    in the big-Oh notation. For example, it is not fashionable to say that the function
    2n2 is O(4n2 + 6n log n), although this is completely correct. We should strive
    instead to describe the function in the big-Oh in simplest terms.
