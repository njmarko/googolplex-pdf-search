 14.6        Shortest Paths
          As we saw in Section 14.3.3, the breadth-ﬁrst search strategy can be used to ﬁnd a
          shortest path from some starting vertex to every other vertex in a connected graph.
          This approach makes sense in cases where each edge is as good as any other, but
          there are many situations where this approach is not appropriate.
               For example, we might want to use a graph to represent the roads between
          cities, and we might be interested in ﬁnding the fastest way to travel cross-country.
          In this case, it is probably not appropriate for all the edges to be equal to each other,
          for some inter-city distances will likely be much larger than others. Likewise, we
          might be using a graph to represent a computer network (such as the Internet), and
          we might be interested in ﬁnding the fastest way to route a data packet between
          two computers. In this case, it again may not be appropriate for all the edges to
          be equal to each other, for some connections in a computer network are typically
          much faster than others (for example, some edges might represent low-bandwidth
          connections, while others might represent high-speed, ﬁber-optic connections). It
          is natural, therefore, to consider graphs whose edges are not weighted equally.
       14.6.1 Weighted Graphs
          A weighted graph is a graph that has a numeric (for example, integer) label w(e)
          associated with each edge e, called the weight of edge e. For e = (u, v), we let
          notation w(u, v) = w(e). We show an example of a weighted graph in Figure 14.14.

          Figure 14.14: A weighted graph whose vertices represent major U.S. airports and
          whose edge weights represent distances in miles. This graph has a path from JFK to
          LAX of total weight 2,777 (going through ORD and DFW). This is the minimum-
          weight path in the graph from JFK to LAX.
