    Other Node Relationships
    Two nodes that are children of the same parent are siblings. A node v is external
    if v has no children. A node v is internal if it has one or more children. External
    nodes are also known as leaves.
    Example 8.1: In Section 4.1.4, we discussed the hierarchical relationship be-
    tween ﬁles and directories in a computer’s ﬁle system, although at the time we
    did not emphasize the nomenclature of a ﬁle system as a tree. In Figure 8.3, we
    revisit an earlier example. We see that the internal nodes of the tree are associ-
    ated with directories and the leaves are associated with regular ﬁles. In the UNIX
    and Linux operating systems, the root of the tree is appropriately called the “root
    directory,” and is represented by the symbol “/.”

                  Figure 8.3: Tree representing a portion of a ﬁle system.
         A node u is an ancestor of a node v if u = v or u is an ancestor of the parent
    of v. Conversely, we say that a node v is a descendant of a node u if u is an ancestor
    of v. For example, in Figure 8.3, cs252/ is an ancestor of papers/, and pr3 is a
    descendant of cs016/. The subtree of T rooted at a node v is the tree consisting of
    all the descendants of v in T (including v itself). In Figure 8.3, the subtree rooted at
    cs016/ consists of the nodes cs016/, grades, homeworks/, programs/, hw1, hw2,
    hw3, pr1, pr2, and pr3.
    Edges and Paths in Trees
    An edge of tree T is a pair of nodes (u, v) such that u is the parent of v, or vice
    versa. A path of T is a sequence of nodes such that any two consecutive nodes in
    the sequence form an edge. For example, the tree in Figure 8.3 contains the path
    (cs252/, projects/, demos/, market).
