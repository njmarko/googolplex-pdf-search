11.4. Splay Trees                                                                           495
              â€¢ When deleting a key k, we splay the position p that is the parent of the re-
                 moved node; recall that by the removal algorithm for binary search trees, the
                 removed node may be that originally containing k, or a descendant node with
                 a replacement key. An example of splaying following a deletion is shown in
                 Figure 11.22.

          Figure 11.22: Deletion from a splay tree: (a) the deletion of 8 from the root node
          is performed by moving to the root the key of its inorder predecessor w, deleting
          w, and splaying the parent p of w; (b) splaying p starts with a zig-zig; (c) after the
          zig-zig; (d) the next step is a zig; (e) after the zig.
