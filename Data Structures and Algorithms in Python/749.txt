    Proposition B.12: If k ‚â• 1 is an integer constant, then
                                        n
                                      ‚àë ik is Œò(nk+1 ).
                                      i=1
        Another common summation is the geometric sum, ‚àëni=0 ai , for any Ô¨Åxed real
    number 0 < a = 1.
    Proposition B.13:
                                       n
                                              an+1 ‚àí 1
                                      ‚àë ai =    a‚àí1
                                                        ,
                                     i=0
    for any real number 0 < a = 1.
    Proposition B.14:
                                          ‚àû
                                                   1
                                         ‚àë ai = 1 ‚àí a
                                         i=0
    for any real number 0 < a < 1.
        There is also a combination of the two common forms, called the linear expo-
    nential summation, which has the following expansion:
    Proposition B.15: For 0 < a = 1, and n ‚â• 2,
                            n
                                     a ‚àí (n + 1)a(n+1) + na(n+2)
                            ‚àë iai =            (1 ‚àí a)2
                                                                 .
                           i=1
        The nth Harmonic number Hn is deÔ¨Åned as
                                                n
                                                   1
                                          Hn = ‚àë .
                                               i=1 i
    Proposition B.16: If Hn is the nth harmonic number, then Hn is ln n + Œò(1).
    Basic Probability
    We review some basic facts from probability theory. The most basic is that any
    statement about a probability is deÔ¨Åned upon a sample space S, which is deÔ¨Åned
    as the set of all possible outcomes from some experiment. We leave the terms
    ‚Äúoutcomes‚Äù and ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù undeÔ¨Åned in any formal sense.
    Example B.17: Consider an experiment that consists of the outcome from Ô¨Çip-
    ping a coin Ô¨Åve times. This sample space has 25 different outcomes, one for each
    different ordering of possible Ô¨Çips that can occur.
        Sample spaces can also be inÔ¨Ånite, as the following example illustrates.
