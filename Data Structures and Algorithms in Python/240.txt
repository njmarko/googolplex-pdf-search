  5.6     Multidimensional Data Sets
          Lists, tuples, and strings in Python are one-dimensional. We use a single index to
          access each element of the sequence. Many computer applications involve mul-
          tidimensional data sets. For example, computer graphics are often modeled in
          either two or three dimensions. Geographic information may be naturally repre-
          sented in two dimensions, medical imaging may provide three-dimensional scans
          of a patient, and a company’s valuation is often based upon a high number of in-
          dependent ﬁnancial measures that can be modeled as multidimensional data. A
          two-dimensional array is sometimes also called a matrix. We may use two indices,
          say i and j, to refer to the cells in the matrix. The ﬁrst index usually refers to a
          row number and the second to a column number, and these are traditionally zero-
          indexed in computer science. Figure 5.22 illustrates a two-dimensional data set
          with integer values. This data might, for example, represent the number of stores
          in various regions of Manhattan.

          Figure 5.22: Illustration of a two-dimensional integer data set, which has 8 rows
          and 10 columns. The rows and columns are zero-indexed. If this data set were
          named stores, the value of stores[3][5] is 100 and the value of stores[6][2] is 632.
              A common representation for a two-dimensional data set in Python is as a list
          of lists. In particular, we can represent a two-dimensional array as a list of rows,
          with each row itself being a list of values. For example, the two-dimensional data
                                        22    18    709       5      33
                                        45    32    830     120     750
                                         4  880      45      66      61
          might be stored in Python as follows.
               data = [ [22, 18, 709, 5, 33], [45, 32, 830, 120, 750], [4, 880, 45, 66, 61] ]
          An advantage of this representation is that we can naturally use a syntax such
          as data[1][3] to represent the value that has row index 1 and column index 3, as
          data[1], the second entry in the outer list, is itself a list, and thus indexable.
