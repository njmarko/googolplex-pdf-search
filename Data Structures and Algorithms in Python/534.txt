          Figure 11.31: An illustration that the red-black tree of Figure 11.30 corresponds to
          the (2, 4) tree of Figure 11.24, based on the highlighted grouping of red nodes with
          their black parents.
              • If w is a 2-node, then keep the (black) children of w as is.
              • If w is a 3-node, then create a new red node y, give w’s last two (black)
                 children to y, and make the ﬁrst child of w and y be the two children of w.
              • If w is a 4-node, then create two new red nodes y and z, give w’s ﬁrst two
                 (black) children to y, give w’s last two (black) children to z, and make y and
                 z be the two children of w.
          Notice that a red node always has a black parent in this construction.
          Proposition 11.9: The height of a red-black tree storing n entries is O(log n).
