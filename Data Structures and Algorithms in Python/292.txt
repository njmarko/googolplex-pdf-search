7.3. Doubly Linked Lists                                                                         271
         Advantage of Using Sentinels
          Although we could implement a doubly linked list without sentinel nodes (as we
          did with our singly linked list in Section 7.1), the slight extra space devoted to the
          sentinels greatly simpliﬁes the logic of our operations. Most notably, the header and
          trailer nodes never change—only the nodes between them change. Furthermore,
          we can treat all insertions in a uniﬁed manner, because a new node will always be
          placed between a pair of existing nodes. In similar fashion, every element that is to
          be deleted is guaranteed to be stored in a node that has neighbors on each side.
               For contrast, look back at our LinkedQueue implementation from Section 7.1.2.
          Its enqueue method, given in Code Fragment 7.8, adds a new node to the end of
          the list. However, its implementation required a conditional to manage the special
          case of inserting into an empty list. In the general case, the new node was linked
          after the existing tail. But when adding to an empty list, there is no existing tail;
          instead it is necessary to reassign self. head to reference the new node. The use of
          a sentinel node in that implementation would eliminate the special case, as there
          would always be an existing node (possibly the header) before a new node.
         Inserting and Deleting with a Doubly Linked List
          Every insertion into our doubly linked list representation will take place between
          a pair of existing nodes, as diagrammed in Figure 7.11. For example, when a new
          element is inserted at the front of the sequence, we will simply add the new node
          between the header and the node that is currently after the header. (See Figure 7.12.)
