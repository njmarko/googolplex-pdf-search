      3.2.1 Comparing Growth Rates
              To sum up, Table 3.1 shows, in order, each of the seven common functions used in
              algorithm analysis.

                  Ideally, we would like data structure operations to run in times proportional
              to the constant or logarithm function, and we would like our algorithms to run in
              linear or n-log-n time. Algorithms with quadratic or cubic running times are less
              practical, and algorithms with exponential running times are infeasible for all but
              the smallest sized inputs. Plots of the seven functions are shown in Figure 3.4.

              Figure 3.4: Growth rates for the seven fundamental functions used in algorithm
              analysis. We use base a = 2 for the exponential function. The functions are plotted
              on a log-log chart, to compare the growth rates primarily as slopes. Even so, the
              exponential function grows too fast to display all its values on the chart.
              The Ceiling and Floor Functions
              One additional comment concerning the functions above is in order. When dis-
              cussing logarithms, we noted that the value is generally not an integer, yet the
              running time of an algorithm is usually expressed by means of an integer quantity,
              such as the number of operations performed. Thus, the analysis of an algorithm
              may sometimes involve the use of the Ô¨Çoor function and ceiling function, which
              are deÔ¨Åned respectively as follows:
                  ‚Ä¢ x = the largest integer less than or equal to x.
                  ‚Ä¢ x = the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.
