      Figure 3.1: Results of an experimental study on the running time of an algorithm.
      A dot with coordinates (n,t) indicates that on an input of size n, the running time
      of the algorithm was measured as t milliseconds (ms).
      Challenges of Experimental Analysis
      While experimental studies of running times are valuable, especially when ﬁne-
      tuning production-quality code, there are three major limitations to their use for
      algorithm analysis:
          • Experimental running times of two algorithms are difﬁcult to directly com-
             pare unless the experiments are performed in the same hardware and software
             environments.
          • Experiments can be done only on a limited set of test inputs; hence, they
             leave out the running times of inputs not included in the experiment (and
             these inputs may be important).
          • An algorithm must be fully implemented in order to execute it to study its
             running time experimentally.
      This last requirement is the most serious drawback to the use of experimental stud-
      ies. At early stages of design, when considering a choice of data structures or
      algorithms, it would be foolish to spend a signiﬁcant amount of time implementing
      an approach that could easily be deemed inferior by a higher-level analysis.
