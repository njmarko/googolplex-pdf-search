11.3. AVL Trees                                                                              487
         Performance of AVL Trees
         By Proposition 11.2, the height of an AVL tree with n items is guaranteed to be
         O(log n). Because the standard binary search tree operation had running times
         bounded by the height (see Table 11.1), and because the additional work in main-
         taining balance factors and restructuring an AVL tree can be bounded by the length
         of a path in the tree, the traditional map operations run in worst-case logarithmic
         time with an AVL tree. We summarize these results in Table 11.2, and illustrate
         this performance in Figure 11.15.

         Figure 11.15: Illustrating the running time of searches and updates in an AVL tree.
         The time performance is O(1) per level, broken into a down phase, which typi-
         cally involves searching, and an up phase, which typically involves updating height
         values and performing local trinode restructurings (rotations).
