    Case 2: The Sibling s of y Is Red. (See Figure 11.34.) In this case, the double red
          denotes an overﬂow in the corresponding (2, 4) tree T  . To ﬁx the problem,
          we perform the equivalent of a split operation. Namely, we do a recoloring:
          we color y and s black and their parent z red (unless z is the root, in which
          case, it remains black). Notice that unless z is the root, the portion of any
          path through the affected part of the tree is incident to exactly one black
          node, both before and after the recoloring. Therefore, the black depth of the
          tree is unaffected by the recoloring unless z is the root, in which case it is
          increased by one.
          However, it is possible that the double-red problem reappears after such a
          recoloring, albeit higher up in the tree T , since z may have a red parent. If
          the double-red problem reappears at z, then we repeat the consideration of the
          two cases at z. Thus, a recoloring either eliminates the double-red problem
          at node x, or propagates it to the grandparent z of x. We continue going
          up T performing recolorings until we ﬁnally resolve the double-red problem
          (with either a ﬁnal recoloring or a trinode restructuring). Thus, the number
          of recolorings caused by an insertion is no more than half the height of tree
          T , that is, O(log n) by Proposition 11.9.
