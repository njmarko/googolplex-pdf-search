            Design a data structure for slicing ﬂoor plans that supports the operations:
               •  Create a ﬂoor plan consisting of a single basic rectangle.
               •  Decompose a basic rectangle by means of a horizontal cut.
               •  Decompose a basic rectangle by means of a vertical cut.
               •  Assign minimum height and width to a basic rectangle.
               •  Draw the slicing tree associated with the ﬂoor plan.
               •  Compact and draw the ﬂoor plan.
