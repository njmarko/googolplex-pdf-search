14.8. Exercises                                                                            687
          R-14.12 Explain why the DFS traversal runs in O(n2 ) time on an n-vertex simple
                  graph that is represented with the adjacency matrix structure.
          R-14.13 In order to verify that all of its nontree edges are back edges, redraw the
                  graph from Figure 14.8b so that the DFS tree edges are drawn with solid
                  lines and oriented downward, as in a standard portrayal of a tree, and with
                  all nontree edges drawn using dashed lines.
          R-14.14 A simple undirected graph is complete if it contains an edge between every
                  pair of distinct vertices. What does a depth-ﬁrst search tree of a complete
                  graph look like?
          R-14.15 Recalling the deﬁnition of a complete graph from Exercise R-14.14, what
                  does a breadth-ﬁrst search tree of a complete graph look like?
          R-14.16 Let G be an undirected graph whose vertices are the integers 1 through 8,
                  and let the adjacent vertices of each vertex be given by the table below:
                                            vertex adjacent vertices
                                              1           (2, 3, 4)
                                              2           (1, 3, 4)
                                              3           (1, 2, 4)
                                              4          (1, 2, 3, 6)
                                              5           (6, 7, 8)
                                              6           (4, 5, 7)
                                              7           (5, 6, 8)
                                              8             (5, 7)
                  Assume that, in a traversal of G, the adjacent vertices of a given vertex are
                  returned in the same order as they are listed in the table above.
                     a. Draw G.
                     b. Give the sequence of vertices of G visited using a DFS traversal
                        starting at vertex 1.
                     c. Give the sequence of vertices visited using a BFS traversal starting
                        at vertex 1.
          R-14.17 Draw the transitive closure of the directed graph shown in Figure 14.2.
          R-14.18 If the vertices of the graph from Figure 14.11 are numbered as (v1 = JFK,
                  v2 = LAX, v3 = MIA, v4 = BOS, v5 = ORD, v6 = SFO, v7 = DFW), in
                  what order would edges be added to the transitive closure during the
                  Floyd-Warshall algorithm?
          R-14.19 How many edges are in the transitive closure of a graph that consists of a
                  simple directed path of n vertices?
          R-14.20 Given an n-node complete binary tree T , rooted at a given position, con-
                  sider a directed graph G  having the nodes of T as its vertices. For each
                  parent-child pair in T , create a directed edge in G from the parent to the
                                                               
                  child. Show that the transitive closure of G has O(n log n) edges.
