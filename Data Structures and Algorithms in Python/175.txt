    Illustrating Ruler Drawing Using a Recursion Trace
    The execution of the recursive draw interval function can be visualized using a re-
    cursion trace. The trace for draw interval is more complicated than in the factorial
    example, however, because each instance makes two recursive calls. To illustrate
    this, we will show the recursion trace in a form that is reminiscent of an outline for
    a document. See Figure 4.3.
                                                                          Output
        draw interval(3)
               draw interval(2)
                        draw interval(1)
                                draw interval(0)
                                  draw line(1)
                                draw interval(0)
                          draw line(2)
                        draw interval(1)
                                draw interval(0)
                                  draw line(1)
                                draw interval(0)
                 draw line(3)
               draw interval(2)
                     (previous pattern repeats)
    Figure 4.3: A partial recursion trace for the call draw interval(3). The second
    pattern of calls for draw interval(2) is not shown, but it is identical to the Ô¨Årst.
