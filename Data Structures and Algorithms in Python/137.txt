    We note that most handheld calculators have a button marked LOG, but this is
    typically for calculating the logarithm base-10, not base-two.
         Computing the logarithm function exactly for any integer n involves the use
    of calculus, but we can use an approximation that is good enough for our pur-
    poses without calculus. In particular, we can easily compute the smallest integer
    greater than or equal to logb n (its so-called ceiling, logb n). For positive integer,
    n, this value is equal to the number of times we can divide n by b before we get
    a number less than or equal to 1. For example, the evaluation of log3 27 is 3,
    because ((27/3)/3)/3 = 1. Likewise, log4 64 is 3, because ((64/4)/4)/4 = 1,
    and log2 12 is 4, because (((12/2)/2)/2)/2 = 0.75 â‰¤ 1.
         The following proposition describes several important identities that involve
    logarithms for any base greater than 1.
    Proposition 3.1 (Logarithm Rules): Given real numbers a > 0, b > 1, c > 0
    and d > 1, we have:
        1. logb (ac) = logb a + logb c
        2. logb (a/c) = logb a âˆ’ logb c
        3. logb (ac ) = c logb a
        4. logb a = logd a/ logd b
        5. blogd a = alogd b
         By convention, the unparenthesized notation lognc denotes the value log(nc ).
    We use a notational shorthand, logc n, to denote the quantity, (log n)c , in which the
    result of the logarithm is raised to a power.
         The above identities can be derived from converse rules for exponentiation that
    we will present on page 121. We illustrate these identities with a few examples.
    Example 3.2: We demonstrate below some interesting applications of the loga-
    rithm rules from Proposition 3.1 (using the usual convention that the base of a
    logarithm is 2 if it is omitted).
         â€¢ log(2n) = log 2 + log n = 1 + log n, by rule 1
         â€¢ log(n/2) = log n âˆ’ log 2 = log n âˆ’ 1, by rule 2
         â€¢ log n3 = 3 log n, by rule 3
         â€¢ log 2n = n log 2 = n Â· 1 = n, by rule 3
         â€¢ log4 n = (log n)/ log 4 = (log n)/2, by rule 4
         â€¢ 2log n = nlog 2 = n1 = n, by rule 5.
    As a practical matter, we note that rule 4 gives us a way to compute the base-two
    logarithm on a calculator that has a base-10 logarithm button, LOG, for
                                    log2 n = LOG n / LOG 2.
