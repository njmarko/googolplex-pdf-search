 Chapter Notes
     Hashing is a well-studied technique. The reader interested in further study is encouraged
     to explore the book by Knuth [65], as well as the book by Vitter and Chen [100]. Skip
     lists were introduced by Pugh [86]. Our analysis of skip lists is a simpliﬁcation of a pre-
     sentation given by Motwani and Raghavan [80]. For a more in-depth analysis of skip lists,
     please see the various research papers on skip lists that have appeared in the data structures
     literature [59, 81, 84]. Exercise C-10.36 was contributed by James Lee.
