      8.2.2 Properties of Binary Trees
          Binary trees have several interesting properties dealing with relationships between
          their heights and number of nodes. We denote the set of all nodes of a tree T at the
          same depth d as level d of T . In a binary tree, level 0 has at most one node (the
          root), level 1 has at most two nodes (the children of the root), level 2 has at most
          four nodes, and so on. (See Figure 8.9.) In general, level d has at most 2d nodes.
                    Level                                                        Nodes

                Figure 8.9: Maximum number of nodes in the levels of a binary tree.
              We can see that the maximum number of nodes on the levels of a binary tree
          grows exponentially as we go down the tree. From this simple observation, we can
          derive the following properties relating the height of a binary tree T with its number
          of nodes. A detailed justiﬁcation of these properties is left as Exercise R-8.8.
          Proposition 8.8: Let T be a nonempty binary tree, and let n, nE , nI and h denote
          the number of nodes, number of external nodes, number of internal nodes, and
          height of T , respectively. Then T has the following properties:
             1. h + 1 ≤ n ≤ 2h+1 − 1
             2. 1 ≤ nE ≤ 2h
             3. h ≤ nI ≤ 2h − 1
             4. log(n + 1) − 1 ≤ h ≤ n − 1
          Also, if T is proper, then T has the following properties:
             1. 2h + 1 ≤ n ≤ 2h+1 − 1
             2. h + 1 ≤ nE ≤ 2h
             3. h ≤ nI ≤ 2h − 1
             4. log(n + 1) − 1 ≤ h ≤ (n − 1)/2
