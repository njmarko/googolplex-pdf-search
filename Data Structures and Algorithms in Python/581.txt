    divide step is performed by scanning the array simultaneously using local variables
    left, which advances forward, and right, which advances backward, swapping pairs
    of elements that are in reverse order, as shown in Figure 12.14. When these two
    indices pass each other, the division step is complete and the algorithm completes
    by recurring on these two sublists. There is no explicit “combine” step, because the
    concatenation of the two sublists is implicit to the in-place use of the original list.
         It is worth noting that if a sequence has duplicate values, we are not explicitly
    creating three sublists L, E, and G, as in our original quick-sort description. We in-
    stead allow elements equal to the pivot (other than the pivot itself ) to be dispersed
    across the two sublists. Exercise R-12.11 explores the subtlety of our implementa-
    tion in the presence of duplicate keys, and Exercise C-12.33 describes an in-place
    algorithm that strictly partitions into three sublists L, E, and G.

    Figure 12.14: Divide step of in-place quick-sort, using index l as shorthand for iden-
    tiﬁer left, and index r as shorthand for identiﬁer right. Index l scans the sequence
    from left to right, and index r scans the sequence from right to left. A swap is per-
    formed when l is at an element as large as the pivot and r is at an element as small
    as the pivot. A ﬁnal swap with the pivot, in part (f ), completes the divide step.
