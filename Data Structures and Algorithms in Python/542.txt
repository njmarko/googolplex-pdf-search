11.6. Red-Black Trees                                                                         521
          Case 2: Node y Is Black and Both Children of y Are Black (or None).
                 Resolving this case corresponds to a fusion operation in the corresponding
                 (2, 4) tree T  , as y must represent a 2-node. We do a recoloring; we color
                 y red, and, if z is red, we color it black. (See Figure 11.39). This does not
                 introduce any red violation, because y does not have a red child.
                 In the case that z was originally red, and thus the parent in the corresponding
                 (2, 4) tree is a 3-node or 4-node, this recoloring resolves the deﬁcit. (See
                 Figure 11.39a.) The path leading to Tlight includes one additional black node
                 in the result, while the recoloring did not affect the number of black nodes
                 on the path to the subtrees of Theavy .
                 In the case that z was originally black, and thus the parent in the correspond-
                 ing (2, 4) tree is a 2-node, the recoloring has not increased the number of
                 black nodes on the path to Tlight ; in fact, it has reduced the number of black
                 nodes on the path to Theavy . (See Figure 11.39b.) After this step, the two chil-
                 dren of z will have the same black height. However, the entire tree rooted at
                 z has become deﬁcient, thereby propogating the problem higher in the tree;
                 we must repeat consideration of all three cases at the parent of z as a remedy.

          Figure 11.39: Resolving a black deﬁcit in Tlight by a recoloring operation: (a) when
          z is originally red, reversing the colors of y and z resolves the black deﬁcit in Tlight ,
          ending the process; (b) when z is originally black, recoloring y causes the entire
          subtree of z to have a black deﬁcit, requiring a cascading remedy.
