           Figure 9.5: Bottom-up construction of a heap with 15 entries: (a and b) we begin by
           constructing 1-entry heaps on the bottom level; (c and d) we combine these heaps
           into 3-entry heaps, and then (e and f ) 7-entry heaps, until (g and h) we create the
           Ô¨Ånal heap. The paths of the down-heap bubblings are highlighted in (d, f, and h).
           For simplicity, we only show the key within each node instead of the entire entry.
