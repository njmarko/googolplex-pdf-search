           Algorithm SkipInsert(k,v):
               Input: Key k and value v

                return q
           Code Fragment 10.13: Insertion in a skip list. Method coinFlip() returns “heads” or
           “tails”, each with probability 1/2. Instance variables n, h, and s hold the number
           of entries, the height, and the start node of the skip list.

           Figure 10.12: Insertion of an entry with key 42 into the skip list of Figure 10.10. We
           assume that the random “coin ﬂips” for the new entry came up heads three times in a
           row, followed by tails. The positions visited are highlighted. The positions inserted
           to hold the new entry are drawn with thick lines, and the positions preceding them
           are ﬂagged.
