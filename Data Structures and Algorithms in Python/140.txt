3.2. The Seven Functions Used in This Book                                                    119
               The lesson to be learned from Proposition 3.3 is that if we perform an algorithm
          with nested loops such that the operations in the inner loop increase by one each
          time, then the total number of operations is quadratic in the number of times, n,
          we perform the outer loop. To be fair, the number of operations is n2 /2 + n/2,
          and so this is just over half the number of operations than an algorithm that uses n
          operations each time the inner loop is performed. But the order of growth is still
          quadratic in n.
      The Cubic Function and Other Polynomials
          Continuing our discussion of functions that are powers of the input, we consider
          the cubic function,
                                                      f (n) = n3 ,
          which assigns to an input value n the product of n with itself three times. This func-
          tion appears less frequently in the context of algorithm analysis than the constant,
          linear, and quadratic functions previously mentioned, but it does appear from time
          to time.
          Polynomials
          Most of the functions we have listed so far can each be viewed as being part of a
          larger class of functions, the polynomials. A polynomial function has the form,
                                    f (n) = a0 + a1 n + a2 n2 + a3 n3 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ad nd ,
          where a0 , a1 , . . . , ad are constants, called the coefÔ¨Åcients of the polynomial, and
          ad = 0. Integer d, which indicates the highest power in the polynomial, is called
          the degree of the polynomial.
               For example, the following functions are all polynomials:
               ‚Ä¢  f (n) = 2 + 5n + n2
               ‚Ä¢  f (n) = 1 + n3
               ‚Ä¢  f (n) = 1
               ‚Ä¢  f (n) = n
               ‚Ä¢  f (n) = n2
          Therefore, we could argue that this book presents just four important functions used
          in algorithm analysis, but we will stick to saying that there are seven, since the con-
          stant, linear, and quadratic functions are too important to be lumped in with other
          polynomials. Running times that are polynomials with small degree are generally
          better than polynomial running times with larger degree.
