    Figure 14.13: Example of a run of algorithm topological sort (Code Frag-
    ment 14.11). The label near a vertex shows its current incount value, and its
    eventual rank in the resulting topological order. The highlighted vertex is one
    with incount equal to zero that will become the next vertex in the topological or-
    der. Dashed lines denote edges that have already been examined and which are no
    longer reï¬‚ected in the incount values.
