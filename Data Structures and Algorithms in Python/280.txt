           Inserting an Element at the Tail of a Singly Linked List
           We can also easily insert an element at the tail of the list, provided we keep a
           reference to the tail node, as shown in Figure 7.5. In this case, we create a new
           node, assign its next reference to None, set the next reference of the tail to point to
           this new node, and then update the tail reference itself to this new node. We give
           the details in Code Fragment 7.2.

           Figure 7.5: Insertion at the tail of a singly linked list: (a) before the insertion;
           (b) after creation of a new node; (c) after reassignment of the tail reference. Note
           that we must set the next link of the tail in (b) before we assign the tail variable to
           point to the new node in (c).
           Algorithm add last(L, e):
                 newest = Node(e) {create new node instance storing reference to element e}
                 newest.next = None         {set new nodeâ€™s next to reference the None object}
                 L.tail.next = newest                     {make old tail node point to new node}
                 L.tail = newest                    {set variable tail to reference the new node}
                 L.size = L.size + 1                                  {increment the node count}
           Code Fragment 7.2: Inserting a new node at the end of a singly linked list. Note
           that we set the next pointer for the old tail node before we make variable tail point
           to the new node. This code would need to be adjusted for inserting onto an empty
           list, since there would not be an existing tail node.
