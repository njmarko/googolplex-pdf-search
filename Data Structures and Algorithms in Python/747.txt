        There are a number of useful inequalities relating to these functions (which
    derive from these deﬁnitions).
    Proposition B.2: If x > −1,
                                      x
                                            ≤ ln(1 + x) ≤ x.

    Proposition B.3: For 0 ≤ x < 1,
                                                           1

    Proposition B.4: For any two positive real numbers x and n,
                                    x   n                     x   n+x/2

    Integer Functions and Relations
    The “ﬂoor” and “ceiling” functions are deﬁned respectively as follows:
       1. x = the largest integer less than or equal to x.
       2. x = the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.
        The modulo operator is deﬁned for integers a ≥ 0 and b > 0 as
                                                          a
                                    a mod b = a −               b.
                                                            b
        The factorial function is deﬁned as
                                 n! = 1 · 2 · 3 · · · · · (n − 1)n.
        The binomial coefﬁcient is
                                      
                                        n              n!
                                             =                  ,
                                        k       k!(n − k)!
    which is equal to the number of different combinations one can deﬁne by choosing
    k different items from a collection of n items (where the order does not matter).
    The name “binomial coefﬁcient” derives from the binomial expansion:
                                                n  
                                                       n k n−k
                                (a + b) = ∑
                                          n
                                                            ab .
                                               k=0 k
