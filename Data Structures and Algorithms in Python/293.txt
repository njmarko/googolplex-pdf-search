    Figure 7.12: Adding an element to the front of a sequence represented by a dou-
    bly linked list with header and trailer sentinels: (a) before the operation; (b) after
    creating the new node; (c) after linking the neighbors to the new node.
        The deletion of a node, portrayed in Figure 7.13, proceeds in the opposite fash-
    ion of an insertion. The two neighbors of the node to be deleted are linked directly
    to each other, thereby bypassing the original node. As a result, that node will no
    longer be considered part of the list and it can be reclaimed by the system. Because
    of our use of sentinels, the same implementation can be used when deleting the Ô¨Årst
    or the last element of a sequence, because even such an element will be stored at a
    node that lies between two others.
