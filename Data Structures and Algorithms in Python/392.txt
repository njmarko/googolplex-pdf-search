          Figure 9.1: Example of a heap storing 13 entries with integer keys. The last position
          is the one storing entry (13,W ).
               The tree in Figure 9.1 is complete because levels 0, 1, and 2 are full, and the six
          nodes in level 3 are in the six leftmost possible positions at that level. In formalizing
          what we mean by the leftmost possible positions, we refer to the discussion of level
          numbering from Section 8.3.2, in the context of an array-based representation of a
          binary tree. (In fact, in Section 9.3.3 we will discuss the use of an array to represent
          a heap.) A complete binary tree with n elements is one that has positions with level
          numbering 0 through n − 1. For example, in an array-based representation of the
          above tree, its 13 entries would be stored consecutively from A[0] to A[12].
         The Height of a Heap
          Let h denote the height of T . Insisting that T be complete also has an important
          consequence, as shown in Proposition 9.2.
          Proposition 9.2: A heap T storing n entries has height h = log n.
          Justiﬁcation: From the fact that T is complete, we know that the number of
          nodes in levels 0 through h − 1 of T is precisely 1+ 2 + 4 + · · · + 2h−1 = 2h − 1, and
          that the number of nodes in level h is at least 1 and at most 2h . Therefore
                    n ≥ 2h − 1 + 1 = 2h        and    n ≤ 2h − 1 + 2h = 2h+1 − 1.
               By taking the logarithm of both sides of inequality 2h ≤ n, we see that height
          h ≤ log n. By rearranging terms and taking the logarithm of both sides of inequality
          n ≤ 2h+1 − 1, we see that log(n + 1) − 1 ≤ h. Since h is an integer, these two
          inequalities imply that h = log n.
