    4.1.2 Drawing an English Ruler
       In the case of computing a factorial, there is no compelling reason for preferring
       recursion over a direct iteration with a loop. As a more complex example of the
       use of recursion, consider how to draw the markings of a typical English ruler. For
       each inch, we place a tick with a numeric label. We denote the length of the tick
       designating a whole inch as the major tick length. Between the marks for whole
       inches, the ruler contains a series of minor ticks, placed at intervals of 1/2 inch,
       1/4 inch, and so on. As the size of the interval decreases by half, the tick length
       decreases by one. Figure 4.2 demonstrates several such rulers with varying major
       tick lengths (although not drawn to scale).

       A Recursive Approach to Ruler Drawing
       The English ruler pattern is a simple example of a fractal, that is, a shape that has
       a self-recursive structure at various levels of magniÔ¨Åcation. Consider the rule with
       major tick length 5 shown in Figure 4.2(b). Ignoring the lines containing 0 and 1,
       let us consider how to draw the sequence of ticks lying between these lines. The
       central tick (at 1/2 inch) has length 4. Observe that the two patterns of ticks above
       and below this central tick are identical, and each has a central tick of length 3.
