       1.1.2 Preview of a Python Program
          As a simple introduction, Code Fragment 1.1 presents a Python program that com-
          putes the grade-point average (GPA) for a student based on letter grades that are
          entered by a user. Many of the techniques demonstrated in this example will be
          discussed in the remainder of this chapter. At this point, we draw attention to a few
          high-level issues, for readers who are new to Python as a programming language.
                Python’s syntax relies heavily on the use of whitespace. Individual statements
          are typically concluded with a newline character, although a command can extend
          to another line, either with a concluding backslash character (\), or if an opening
          delimiter has not yet been closed, such as the { character in deﬁning value map.
                Whitespace is also key in delimiting the bodies of control structures in Python.
          Speciﬁcally, a block of code is indented to designate it as the body of a control
          structure, and nested control structures use increasing amounts of indentation. In
          Code Fragment 1.1, the body of the while loop consists of the subsequent 8 lines,
          including a nested conditional structure.
                Comments are annotations provided for human readers, yet ignored by the
          Python interpreter. The primary syntax for comments in Python is based on use
          of the # character, which designates the remainder of the line as a comment.
          print( Welcome to the GPA calculator. )
          print( Please enter all your letter grades, one per line. )
          print( Enter a blank line to designate the end. )
          # map from letter grade to point value
          points = { A+ :4.0, A :4.0, A- :3.67, B+ :3.33, B :3.0, B- :2.67,
                        C+ :2.33, C :2.0, C :1.67, D+ :1.33, D :1.0, F :0.0}
          num courses = 0
          total points = 0
          done = False
          while not done:
             grade = input( )                                  # read line from user
             if grade == :                                     # empty line was entered
                done = True
             elif grade not in points:                         # unrecognized grade entered
                print("Unknown grade {0} being ignored".format(grade))
             else:
                num courses += 1
                total points += points[grade]
          if num courses > 0:                                  # avoid division by zero
             print( Your GPA is {0:.3} .format(total points / num courses))
